Hey Prof. In order to run this game, you may need to install Python if it isn't already installed on your computer. The install info for PC and Mac can be found here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/

If on a Debian version of Linux, open terminal and run: sudo apt-get install python3

To run on Windows, download this file into your PC, and open the Windows Powershell. type: "cd Downloads", and then "python ethics.py"
To run on Linux, download the file and open its location in Terminal. run: "sudo python3 ethics.py" without any quotation marks. 

That should be all you need to run this game, but if you have any problems running it whatsoever, please contact me. Thanks.
